Long  ,, "a" go in Ethiopia!
a woman named Leeya married a man who had a son.
His wife had died several years before.
Try as Leeya might, she could not seem to spark a connection with the child.
She offered the boy food, and he refused to eat.
She spoke softly to him, and he turned away.
She sat next to him, and he would get up and walk away.
After several months of this, Leeya didn’t know what to do.
Now in Leeya’s village there was a medicine man, a healer,
who lived off in the mountains.
When anyone in the village was sick or hurting,
a visit to him would do the trick.
Most of the time, Leeya felt she could fix her own problems.
But not this time.
She needed help!
As Leeya came up to the healer’s hut,
she saw the door was open.
The old doctor said without turning around, "I hear you coming.
What’s the problem?"
The Stories of English is a 2004 book by British linguist David Crystal;
it traces the history of the English language
from the invasion of Great Britain by the Angles and
Saxons in the 5th Century to the modern splintering of the language into
its modern British, American, Indian, Australian, and other dialects.
One primary focus of the book is a history of British English,
from its Old English beginnings to Middle English,
Early Modern English, and Modern English.
Crystal also argues eloquently for the inclusion of dialects and
"non-standard" varieties of English. Even for the Old English period,
he shows how the available evidence can be used to determine
what dialectal variation existed.
Finally, Crystal condemns
what he sees as the over-abundance of linguistic
prescription in the study of English,
especially that which existed from the 18th Century to the 20th.
He speaks approvingly of the recent shift of focus in English
language education away from prescriptivism.
